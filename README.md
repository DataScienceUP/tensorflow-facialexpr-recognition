All code is commented by line and consist in several parts, you have to follow the next recommendations in order to run it:

- It needs the first original data from the competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
- You have to follow the relabeling from microsoft FER2013 plus, https://github.com/microsoft/FERPlus
